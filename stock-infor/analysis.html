    <div class="financial-data">
        <h2>Financial insight</h2>
        <p>Past 127 days increase in return by 66.24%</p>
       <p>Current price change slightly from $25 to $23 for these 2 weeks. This possibly can be a result of buying SM. Eventhrough SM is one of the top company about Kpop in Korea, there is no big event( MV from EXO, concert,...) organized by SM.The market is unpatient that it decides this investment is not good.</p>
        <p>Notice the P/E ratio is much higher than the P/B ratio. Investors are willing to buy a high price for a much lower earning. This means that they see a big potential of TME in the long run. On the other hand, the stock is not valued enough when comparing with the book value</p>
        <div class="Pay attention to how TME makes money">
            TME is not rely heavy on asset. Their income coming from music streaming and other entertainment service relates to music. This mean TME has a low P/B ratio is reasonable and should not affect the growth of it in the future. Only pay attention to P/E ratio is enough.
