        <p>Current price change slightly from $25 to $23 for these 2 weeks. This possibly can be a result of buying SM. Eventhrough SM is one of the top company about Kpop in Korea, there is no big event( MV from EXO, concert,...) organized by SM.The market is unpatient that it decides this investment is not good.</p>
